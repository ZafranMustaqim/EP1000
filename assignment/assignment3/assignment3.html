                    <p>Our third assignment was to research more on the final project that I intend to build.
                        I first went to websites like Instructables and Thingyverse to look as projects that people have done and build mine around one.                       
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I chose to make a door sensor. This door sensor will track when the door is moving.
                        It could also detect if the door is being opened or if someone is closing the door.
                    </p>
                    <table width="500px" width="100%" border="0">
                        <tr>
                            <td align="left" valign="center">
                              <img src="../../images/sensor.jpg" alt="sensor" style="width:160px;height:200px"
                            </td>
                            <td align="center" valign="left">
                               The sensor revolves around this magnetic switch that sends a signal to Arduino that the door is moving.
                            </td>
                        </tr>
