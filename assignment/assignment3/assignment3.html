                    <p>Our third assignment is on website development using html and css using Jake Wrights template. For this assignment, I decided to use Visual Studio Code for develpoing this website.
                        After copying his base template, we are required to add information relating to ourselves. Inside the website, I introduced myself and there is a selfie of myself.
                        Other than introducing myself, I also stated why I chose this module and what I intend to learn from it.
                        There is also the project that I intend to build and what would be different.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Assignment 3B</h3>
                    <p>The second part of this assignment is to have a website presence by uploading it onto GitHub.
