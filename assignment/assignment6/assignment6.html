                    <p>This is the name tag that I made using Fusion 360.
                        It took a while to make as I was still getting used to the interface of Fusion 360 and the functions that it has.
                        I started by creating a rectangle base then rounding off the edges so that it does not snag.
                        After that i created the keyhole then extruded the model.
                        Then, i offset the whole model and extruded the model to depress it to fit the letters.
                        I then typed in my name into the center of the nametag then extruded that to get the final product as seen above.

                    <p>
                        This is the box I made using parametric functions. Using a parametric function is to assign a variable a value.
                        If I were to use the height of the box as an example, I would assign the height of the box to be 80mm inside a parametric function.
                        This means that if I were to want to change the height of the box, I can simply go into the parametric function to change the value assigned to height and the height of the box will change.
                        This is opposed to me individually selecting each side of the box and manually changing the height.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After creating a sketch for a side of the box, I extruded it. I then created a component for the left side of the box and sketched it as well.
                        After extruding the left side of the box, I had to use the combine function to join both sides as well as cut away the tabs.
                        The problem now is that I am missing 2 sides of the box. To resolve this, I constructed a midplane for the front and left side of the box so that I can mirror these sides.
                        After creating the remaining sides, I created the base using the previous steps I used to create the walls of the box.
