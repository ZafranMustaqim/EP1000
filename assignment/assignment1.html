                       Finally I cut out the phone stand and put my phone on it to show that it can support the weight of my phone without jeopardising too much of the display.

            <p>The phone stand that I created could use a lot of refining to make it look neater. It is not that portable even though it can fold as it was still pretty big.
              It could have folded a bit more to make it more portable. The profile of the stand could also be cut out better to make it more presentable.
              I think that the problem could have been due to me lacking cardboard. This means that I had lesser cardboard to work with.
