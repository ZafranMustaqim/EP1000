                    <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
                    <p>Our first assignment for DFAB was to create a handphone stand made out of cardboard. We had to first sketch out the intended design of the stand and make it out of cardboard.
                      I first had to measure the size of my phone which is an Iphone 11 Pro Max. The height of the phone is 158 mm and the width of it is 77.8 mm.
                      From this, measurements, I drew a sketch of what the prototype will look like. After creating a sketch, I proceeded to make the phone stand.
                      Overall, I think that the stand that I made was not that well designed and could be improved on.
