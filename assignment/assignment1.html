                    <h2>Assignment 1</h2>
                    <p>Our very first assignment for this module is to pass a FabLab Safety quiz.
                      Passing this quiz allows students access into FabLab so that they can use the machinery required for their projects.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Basic Safety</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        It is mandatory to be properly dressed. No slippers and sandals are allowed in FabLab.
                        Loose items hanging around neck and arms are also not allowed. Ladies have to have their hair tied neatly.
                        Loose clothes are not allowed.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        There must be a lecturer with you if you are not certified or allowed to enter FabLab.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      After this lesson, we were required to donwload and install Fusion 360 which is used to do 3D modeling
                      in the future. Other than this, we were also required to download a text editor to create our website.
                      I chose to download and use Visual Studio Code as it has a built in way to push my website to GitHub.
