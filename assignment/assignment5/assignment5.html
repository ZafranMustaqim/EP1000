                    <p>For this assignment, we had to use git to push our website onto GitHub. Git is a distributed version control system designed for tracking changes in any set of files.
                        GitHub is a code hosting platform that allows version control and collaboration.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Steps to push</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The first step is to create a repository in Github.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next step is to open Git Bash and to create a local project that is directed to the current working directory.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Use the command <strong>pwd</strong> to print out the current directory.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Use the command <strong>cd 'path name'</strong> to move to the specified path in your local computer.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next is to use the command <strong>git init</strong> to initialise the repository.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use the command <strong>git add</strong> to add all the files to the given folder.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    You can use the command <strong>git status</strong> to view all the files that are going to be staged to the first commit.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After uploading the file, use the command <strong>git commit -m 'your message'</strong> to commit the content with a description of what was changed and why it was changed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next, copy the URL of your GitHub's remote repository and use the command <strong>git remote add origin 'your URL name'.</strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally, push the whole code into your GitHub repository by using the command <strong>git push -u origin master</strong> and input your GitHub username and password.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
