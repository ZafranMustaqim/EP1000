                                This is the name tag that I made using Fusion 360.
                                It took a while to make as I was still getting used to the interface of Fusion 360 and the functions that it has.
                                I started by creating a rectangle base then rounding off the edges so that it does not snag.
                                After that i created the keyhole then extruded the model.
                                Then, i offset the whole model and extruded the model to depress it to fit the letters.
                                I then typed in my name into the center of the nametag then extruded that to get the final product as seen above.
